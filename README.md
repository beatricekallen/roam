# Roam

## Description

Roam is an app for people who want to travel sustainably. Traveling is great and we love it — but it also takes a toll on the planet. We wanted to create a fun, user-friendly application so people can travel while being mindful of climate change.

Users can connect and plan trips with friends. Users can create and store itineraries, track expenses and split them at the end of their trip, and even offset the carbon emissions from their trip by donating to a charity, all through Roam.

## Technologies

Built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Material UI, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo, and Stripe.
